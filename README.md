This repository contains data, code and final report of the project 'Exploring the Impact of Demographic Factors, Medical History, and Medicine Usage on Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment Outcome'

As the global population continues to age, the prevalence of people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is expected to rise significantly. AD is a progressive neurode- generative disorder primarily affecting older people and placing a burden on families and societies worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective strategies addressing these burdens and ensuring the well-being of ageing populations around the world. This project will explore the impact of demographic factors, medical history, and medicine us- age on AD treatment outcome, providing insights for understanding treatment responses, identifying risk factors, improving treatment strategies, and informing healthcare policy- making and decision-making. These insights have the potential to enhance patient care, optimise resource allocation, and ultimately improve AD’s overall management.

Questions of interest
* How do demographic factors such as age and gender affect the treatment outcome of AD? Are there any differences in treatment outcomes with different demographic groups?
* What is the association between certain medical conditions or comorbidities and AD treatment outcome?
* Are there any specific medicines that are more commonly associated with positive treatment outcomes?
