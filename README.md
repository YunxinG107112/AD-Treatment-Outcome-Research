This repository contains data, code and final report of the project 'Exploring the Impact of Demographic Factors, Medical History, and Medicine Usage on Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment Outcome'

Background: As the global population continues to age, the prevalence of people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is expected to rise significantly. AD is a progressive neurode- generative disorder primarily affecting older people and placing a burden on families and societies worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective strategies addressing these burdens and ensuring the well-being of ageing populations around the world. This project will explore the impact of demographic factors, medical history, and medicine us- age on AD treatment outcome, providing insights for understanding treatment responses, identifying risk factors, improving treatment strategies, and informing healthcare policy- making and decision-making. These insights have the potential to enhance patient care, optimise resource allocation, and ultimately improve AD’s overall management.

Methods: Data were collected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including demographic information, clinical and visit information, medical history, and medicine usage. We used cognitive decline as the indicator to demonstrate the treatment outcome. 0 indicated a negative treatment outcome where the cognitive decline was progressive, and 1 indicated a positive treatment outcome where the cognitive function of the patient remained stable or improved. Initially, logistic regression analysis (R) was applied to identify factors that had a relatively high association with the treatment outcome. Machine learning (Python) was then conducted to predict the treatment outcome of AD, using the factors identified from statistical analysis.


Questions of interest
- How do demographic factors such as age and gender affect the treatment outcome of AD? Are there any differences in treatment outcomes with different demographic groups?
- What is the association between certain medical conditions or comorbidities and AD treatment outcome?
- Are there any specific medicines that are more commonly associated with positive treatment outcomes?

Conclusions: Older patients tend to have lower chances of positive AD treatment outcome. Additionally, higher independence levels correlate with a greater likelihood of positive outcomes, possibly because increased personal freedom and self-determination benefit patients’ well-being. Regarding medical conditions, patients manifesting behaviour changes like social withdrawal are more prone to declined cognitive treatment outcomes. This behaviour might indicate a more advanced AD stage, reducing the likelihood of positive outcomes. Last, donepezil and memantine have a relatively higher association with AD treatment outcome.
